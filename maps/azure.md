    - Archive. Stored for at least 180 days
  - Redundancy
    - Locally redundant storage (LRS). At least 11 nines (99.999999999%) 
    - Zone-redundant storage (ZRS). At least 12 nines (99.9999999999%)

## IAM

- Microsoft Entra Domain Services  
- Single sign-on (SSO)
- Multifactor authentication
- Passwordless authentication
  - Windows Hello for Business
  - Microsoft Authenticator app
  - FIDO2 security keys
- FIDO2 security keys
- B2B direct connect
- Conditional Access
  - Role. Has an associated set of access permissions
  - Scopes include:
    - A management group (a collection of multiple subscriptions).
    - A single subscription.
    - A resource group.
    - A single resource.
- Zero Trust
  - Guiding principles
    - Verify explicitly - Always authenticate and authorize based on the available data points
    - Use least privilege access - Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough access (JIT/JEA)
    - Assume breach - Segment access by network, user, devices, and application.
  - Six foundational pillars
    - Identities may be users, services, or devices
    - Devices create a large attack surface as data flows from devices to on-premises workloads and the cloud
    - Applications are the way that data is consumed.
    - Data should be classified, labeled, and encrypted based on its attributes.
    - Infrastructure, whether on-premises or cloud based, represents a threat vector.
    - Networks should be segmented, including deeper in-network micro segmentation.
- Encryption
  - Data at rest - stored on a physical device
  - Data in transit - HTTPS
  - Data in use - securing data in RAM or CPU
- Governance, risk, and compliance
  - Governance is the system of rules, practices, and processes an organization uses to direct and control its activities. 
  - Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and responding to threats or events that can impact company or customer objectives. 
  - Compliance refers to the country/region, state, or federal laws or even multi-national regulations that an organization must follow.
    - Data residency - govern the physical locations where data can be stored and how and when it can be transferred, processed, or accessed internationally.
    - Data sovereignty - data, particularly personal data, is subject to the laws and regulations of the country/region in which it's physically collected, held, or processed. 
    - Data privacy - Providing notice and being transparent about the collection, processing, use, and sharing of personal data are fundamental principles of privacy laws and regulations.
